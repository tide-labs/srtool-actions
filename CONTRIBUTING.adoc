WARNING: This project is using `asciidoc` for its documentation. You should **not** edit any mardown file (`.md`) as your changes would be dismissed.

Instead you should be editing the `.adoc` file and the markdown files will be generated. If you create a PR and do not have any of the required tooling, feel free to only edit the `.adoc.` files and I will generate the new `.md`.
